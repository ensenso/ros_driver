# Official ROS driver for [Ensenso](http://www.ensenso.com) stereo cameras [![Build&Test](https://github.com/ensenso/ros_driver/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ensenso/ros_driver/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)


## Documentation

To get started with the package, take a look at the [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ensenso_driver).

If you want to use the package with ROS2, see our [ROS2 documentation](docs/ROS2.md) on how to build for ROS2 and for
further information.

## Remarks
 * For using this package, you need to have the [Ensenso SDK](https://www.ensenso.com/support/sdk-download) installed.
 * Ensenso B-Series cameras require at least version 2.1.3
 * Ensenso C-Series cameras require at least version 2.1.1
 * Ensenso S- and XR-Series cameras require at least version 1.7.0.
 * Version 1.7.0 and newer requires at least Ensenso SDK 3.0.
 * Version 1.6.3 and older requires at least Ensenso SDK 2.0. Older versions are not supported.
 * All inputs and outputs of this package are in meters and seconds, as the convention for ROS requires. This is different from the NxLib, which uses millimeters and milliseconds.

## Report a Bug

For general problems with your camera or the Ensenso SDK, please visit the [Ensenso community forum](https://community.ensenso.com) or contact the [IDS support](https://en.ids-imaging.com/support.html).
