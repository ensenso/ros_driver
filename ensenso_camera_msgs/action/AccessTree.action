# This action gives direct access to the NxLib JSON tree. It is meant to be used
# only when the functionality that is provided by the rest of this package is
# not enough for your use case.
#
# The action takes the path to a tree item. It then modifies the item according
# to the other parameters that are given in the action goal. The default values
# do not change anything.
# Once all modifications are done, it extracts the current value of the item and
# returns it in the action's result.
#
# Note: Be careful when accessing the tree directly. Other actions overwrite
#       the camera's whole parameter tree when they switch between different
#       parameter sets.

# A parameter set that gets loaded before accessing the tree. When the action
# writes to the JSON tree, the changes will also be saved into this parameter
# set.
