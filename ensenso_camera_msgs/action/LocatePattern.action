# The parameter set that will be used for capturing the image before searching

string parameter_set

# Optional. Takes multiple images and averages the position of the calibration
# pattern. This allows a more precise estimation of the pose.
# Note: When there is more than one visible pattern, the averaging is not
# supported by the NxLib. In that case, the capturing is canceled after the
# first shot and the pose of all each pattern is estimated from this single
# image.

# The frame in which the pattern position is calculated. If this is empty, it
# will be the same frame that is used for the point cloud.
string target_frame

# Publish the pattern pose as TF transformation from the target frame to the
# frame given here. If this is empty, the pose will not be published on TF.
# Note: When there is more than one visible pattern, it is not clear which pose
# should be published. In that case, the node will not publish any
# transformation.

# The estimated pattern poses.

# Information about the patterns. When there is only one pattern visible and we
